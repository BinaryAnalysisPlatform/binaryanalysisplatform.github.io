<P>

<B>propagate-taint</B> [<I>OPTION</I>]... 
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

A taint propagation framework, that uses microexecution to propagate the taint through a program. The execution is perfomed using the ConquEror Engine, that is short for Concrete Evaluation with Errors. This execution engine allows to run incomplete programs with an unspecified user input. Moreover, to increase the coverage it may take infeasible paths.
<P>

The taint is propagated from a seed to its maximum extent. The seed is a definition point that is marked with a `Taint.reg` or `Taint.ptr` tag. A usual way of using the framework, would be to use one or more passes that marks points of interest with a taint seed, then to use the `propagate-taint` pass to propagate the taint, and, finally, to use a pass that will collect and analyze the result.
<P>

The microexecution is performed over a lifted program using bap-microx library. Memory reads are intercepted and redirected to program image, if possible (for static data), otherwise they are concretized. All other inputs, like reads from unknown registers or user input are also concretized. Several concretization policies are provided:
<P>

<PRE>

      - Const - all unknown values are concretized to a specified constant;
      - Random - a random value is picked from a value domain;
      - Range - a random value is picked from a specified range.
</PRE>

<P>

By default, the microexecution engine tries to visit all program branches. During the execution, it will record missed branches as checkpoints. When there is nothing more to explore, it will backtrack to a stored checkpoint, restoring the execution state at this program point, and continue the execution. Of course, in this case the state will contradict with a path constraint. In a deterministic mode the bactracking mechanism is disabled. In this mode, no checkpoints are recorded, and whenever the interpreter requests a backtracking, it will instead return from a current procedure.
<P>

The maximum length of an execution path is limited with some constant number of jumps (basic blocks). Also, a loop escaping mechanism, will detect loops and bail out of them after a specified amount of iterations. In the deterministic mode it will just return from a procedure, otherwise, it will backtrack.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--deterministic</B><DD>
Run in a deterministic mode. In this mode we will follow only one execution path, without backtracking, giving a more feasable result, but much less coverage
<DT><B>--help</B>[=<I>FMT</I>] (default=pager)<DD>
Show this help in format <I>FMT</I> (pager, plain or groff).
<DT><B>--interesting</B>=<I>VAL</I><DD>
Look only at specified functions
<DT><B>--max-iterations</B>=<I>N</I> (absent=10)<DD>
Limit loop to <I>N</I> iterations
<DT><B>--max-trace</B>=<I>BLOCKS</I> (absent=1000000)<DD>
Limit maximum trace length to <I>BLOCKS</I>
<DT><B>--mem-value</B>=<I>VAL</I> (absent=random)<DD>
Input generation policy. If set to a fixed value, e.g. `0', then all undefined memory locations will be concretized to this value. If set to an interval, e.g., `(0 5)', then values will be randomly picked from this interval (boundaries including). If set to `random', then values will be picked randomly from a domain, defined by a type of value.
<DT><B>--random-seed</B>=<I>VAL</I><DD>
Initialize random number generator with the given seed
<DT><B>--reg-value</B>=<I>VAL</I> (absent=random)<DD>
Input generation policy. If set to a fixed value, e.g. `0', then all undefined registers will be concretized to this value. If set to an interval, e.g., `(0 5)', then values will be randomly picked from this interval (boundaries including). If set to `random', then values will be picked randomly from a domain, defined by a type of value.
