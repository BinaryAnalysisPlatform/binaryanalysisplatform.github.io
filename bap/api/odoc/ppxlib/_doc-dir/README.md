# Overview

The ppxlib project provides the basis for the ppx system, which is
currently the officially supported method for meta-programming in
OCaml. It offers a principled way to generate code at compile time in
OCaml projects.

Ppxlib comes with a [user manual](http://ppxlib.readthedocs.io/) aimed
at both users and authors of ppx rewriters.

# History

This repository was created by merging several older projects. See
