<P>

The Primus Taint Analysis Framework Control Module
<P>

This plugin enables fine tuning of the Taint Analysis Framework, exposes the framework interface to Primus Lisp programs, and provides several useful components&#46;
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Taint Propagation Policies</H2>

<P>

In the Taint Analysis Framework the taint propagation could be assigned individually based on a taint kind&#46; If no policy was assigned, then the default is used (selectable using this module)&#46; It is possible to implement custom policy&#46; This module provides two policies: <B>propagate-by-computation</B> (default) and <B>propagate-exactly</B>&#46; The <B>propagate-by-computation</B> policy propagates a taint to the result of any computation&#46; The <B>propagate-exactly</B> policy is more strict and propagate taint if is an operation is store, load, cast, or concat&#46;
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>Taint Garbage Collectors</H2>

<P>

It is possible to track the liveness of a taint, i&#46;e&#46;, whether it is reachable from any live value&#46; By default we use a conservative garbage collector that sometimes gives a taint more credit than it deserves, in other words a taint may be treated as live even if it is no longer reachable&#46; When a taint is destroyed, either because it is not longer reachable or because a machine is finished, a taint finalizer, that is reflected to the <B>taint-finalize</B>, Lisp signal is called, with the taint itself, and a boolean parameter that tells whether the taint was still live or dead, when the finalization was called&#46;
