<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

Provides a set of operations to store and manipulate interval trees&#46; The module provides a persistent storage for intervals, denoted in the module as regions, since these intervals often represent memory regions&#46; Intervals are stored in interval sets, that are implemented as efficient interval tree data structures (using AVL trees underneath the hood)&#46; Each interval set is denoted with a symbol, and it is possible to create arbitrary number of sets, as well as move regions from one set to another&#46;
