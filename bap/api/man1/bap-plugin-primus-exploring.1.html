<P>

The exploring scheduler will prioritize clones that will wonder into not yet explored or less explored areas&#46; More specifically, from a set of machine clones, it will choose those, that will proceed to a basic block that was visited the least amount of times&#46; The round-robin scheduler will switch the context after each basic block&#46; It will count the number of time the block was evaluated
