<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

Identifies function starts using a predefined sets of function start signatures&#46; Each signature is a sequence of bytes equipped with a sample probability of occuring it as a function start&#46; The input memory is scanned, and for each byte that is not yet classified as a function start the longest sequence of bytes is searched in the signatures&#46; If one is found, then the <B>threshold</B> parameter defines the decision procedure&#46; If it is a value below <B>1&#46;0</B> then the sequence of bytes will be classified as a function start if the the associated probability is higher than the specified threshold&#46; If the threshold is greater or equal than 1&#46;0, then the sequence of bytes will be classified as a function start if the Bayes factor of the two competing hypothesis is greater than the specified threshold&#46; The Bayes factor is the ratio between the posterior probabilities of the competing hypothesis&#46; Therefore, it includes the prior odds of finding a function start, which makes the hypothesis testing more robust&#46; The Bayes factor value is having the following interpretations:

    Bayes Factor          Strength

    1 to 3&#46;2              Weak
    3&#46;2 to 10             Substantial
    10 to 100             Strong
    100 and greater       Decisive;

<P>

This plugin is a partial implementation of the starts, partially BYTEWEIGHT algorithm as described in [1]&#46; Only the byte level matching is implemented&#46; The <B>SEE ALSO</B> section contains links to other plugins, that provide function identification services&#46;
