<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

Provide caching service for all data types&#46; The caching entry point is defined in the [Data] module of the [Regular] library&#46;
<P>

The cache plugin implements lock-free store/loading operations with <A HREF="../man1/O.1.html">O</A>(1) complexity: the same cache folder can be safely shared between different processes without any performance impact and these operations don&#39;t depend on the cache size&#46;
<P>

Also, the plugin maintains the cache size below the certain level, unless the garbage collector is manually disabled via <B>--disable-gc</B> option&#46; The maximum occupied size of the cache is controlled by the <B>size</B> and <B>overhead</B> parameters and can be expressed as <B> total-size = size + overhead * size</B>, where <B>size</B> is a cache capacity in Mb and <B>overhead</B> is the percentage of allowed excess&#46; Once the cache size reaches this maximum, <B> 2 * capacity * overhead</B> of entries will be removed by GC on the next program run&#46;
<P>

GC is also lock-free and removes cache entries randomly with prioritizing larger ones&#46;
