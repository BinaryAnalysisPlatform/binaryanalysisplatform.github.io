<P>

The greedy scheduling strategy will continue with the same state, unless the machine reaches a termination state, i&#46;e&#46;, when the <B>next</B> value in a context becomes <B>None</B>&#46; In that case another alive state that has a <B>next</B> value that is not <B>None</B> is chosen&#46; If such state doesn&#39;t exist, then the Machine finally terminates&#46; Thus this strategy will perform a depth-first traversal of the state tree, and guarantees that all paths are explored&#46; The greedy scheduler will attempt to reschedule every time a basic block is evaluated&#46;
