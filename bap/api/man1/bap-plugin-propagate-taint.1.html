<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

A taint propagation framework, that uses microexecution to propagate the taint through a program&#46; The execution is performed using the ConquEror Engine, that is short for Concrete Evaluation with Errors&#46; This execution engine allows to run incomplete programs with an unspecified user input&#46; Moreover, to increase the coverage it may take infeasible paths&#46;
<P>

The taint is propagated from a seed to its maximum extent&#46; The seed is a definition point that is marked with a `Taint&#46;reg` or `Taint&#46;ptr` tag&#46; A usual way of using the framework, would be to use one or more passes that marks points of interest with a taint seed, then to use the `propagate-taint` pass to propagate the taint, and, finally, to use a pass that will collect and analyze the result&#46;
<P>

The microexecution is performed over a lifted program using bap-microx library&#46; Memory reads are intercepted and redirected to program image, if possible (for static data), otherwise they are concretized&#46; All other inputs, like reads from unknown registers or user input are also concretized&#46; Several concretization policies are provided:
<P>

<PRE>


      - Const - all unknown values are concretized to a specified constant;
      - Random - a random value is picked from a value domain;
      - Range - a random value is picked from a specified range&#46;

</PRE>

<P>

By default, the microexecution engine tries to visit all program branches&#46; During the execution, it will record missed branches as checkpoints&#46; When there is nothing more to explore, it will backtrack to a stored checkpoint, restoring the execution state at this program point, and continue the execution&#46; Of course, in this case the state will contradict with a path constraint&#46; In a deterministic mode the bactracking mechanism is disabled&#46; In this mode, no checkpoints are recorded, and whenever the interpreter requests a backtracking, it will instead return from a current procedure&#46;
<P>

The maximum length of an execution path is limited with some constant number of jumps (basic blocks)&#46; Also, a loop escaping mechanism, will detect loops and bail out of them after a specified amount of iterations&#46; In the deterministic mode it will just return from a procedure, otherwise, it will backtrack&#46;
