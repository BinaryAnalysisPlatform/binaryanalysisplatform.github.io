<P>

Beagle is an obfuscated string solver that uses CPU emulation for discovering and decoding strings&#46; Beagle can also be used as an advanced data cross-referrence tool&#46; Beagle combines Microexecution with digital signal processing techniques and efficient dictionary search&#46; Data that pass through a CPU emulator is processed with a low-pass filter and string-like patterns are detected&#46; At the final step, words are recovered from a detected shuffled sequence of characters&#46; For this we employ a scrabble-like algorithm, that will detect all possible words, that can be built from a given sequence of characters&#46; The algorithm is parameterized by a dictionary&#46; It can be just an English dictionary, but it can be also a dictionary built from signatures obtained from a known compromised software&#46; The dictionary search algorithm uses a special trie data structure with a search procedure that doesn&#39;t depend on the size of a dictionary or the size of a character sequence&#46;
