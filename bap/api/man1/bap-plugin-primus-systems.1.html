<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

Loads Primus systems and registers them in the system repository&#46; The systems are searched in the following directories:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-<DD>
the current working directory;
<DT>-<DD>
the directories specified by <B>--primus-system-add-path</B>;
<DT>-<DD>
the directory specified at the configuration time, usually ($share/primus)
</DL>
<P>

The directories are searched and all files that have the [&#46;asd] extension are loaded&#46; Each file may define more than one system and reference other systems (via the [depends-on]) no matter whether they are loaded before or after (systems and components are resolved when the system is run)&#46; Each system should have a distinctive name and if there are systems with repetetive names an exception is raised&#46;
<P>

The system description file has the following grammar:
<P>

<PRE>

   systems ::= &lt;system-definition&gt; &#46;&#46;&#46;
   system-definition ::= (defsystem &lt;ident&gt; &lt;option&gt; &#46;&#46;&#46;)
   option ::=
     | :description &lt;string&gt;
     | :components (&lt;ident&gt; &#46;&#46;&#46;)
     | :depends-on (&lt;ident&gt; &#46;&#46;&#46;)
   ident ::= &lt;string&gt; | &lt;string&gt;:&lt;string&gt;

The <B>:components</B> option is the list of components that comprise the
system&#46; And the <B> :depends-on</B> option specifies the list of
systems on which the defined system depends&#46; The components of those
systems are essentially copied to the defined system&#46;

This plugin also provides introspection commands <B>primus-systems</B>,
<B>primus-components</B>, and <B>primus-observations</B> that provides the
lists of currently known systems, components, and observations&#46; See
corresponding command help pages for more information&#46;
