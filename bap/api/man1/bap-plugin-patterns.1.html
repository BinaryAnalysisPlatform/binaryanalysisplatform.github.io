<A NAME="lbAB">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>

Applies semantic actions to the matching byte patterns&#46; The patterns are specified in an XML format, described below, and the actions are implemented with Primus Lisp methods&#46; Used to identify function starts, instruction encodings, function names, etc&#46;
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INPUT FORMAT</H2>

<P>

The patterns are represented with XML files, each corresponding to a specific target&#46; The <B>patternconstraints&#46;xml</B> files are used as the table of contents and contain mapping between targets and files that provide patterns for that target&#46;
<P>

The file scheme itself is derived from the Ghidra bytesearch patterns, so that the patterns provided by Ghidra could be used as is&#46;
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PATTERNS SCHEME</H2>

<P>

The file with patterns must have a single element <B> patternlist</B>, which contains a list of <B>pattern</B> or <B>patternpairs</B> elements&#46; The <B>pattern</B> element is composed of a list of <B>data</B> elements and a list of action elements&#46; The <B>data</B> element descibes the ditted pattern, and an action is any element (other than <B>data</B>), which is translated to a Primus Lisp singal, <B>bap:patterns-action name addr attrs</B>, where <B>name</B> is the element name, <B>addr</B> is the address where the pattern matches, and <B>attrs</B> is the list of element attributes, accessible via <B>patterns-attribute</B> function&#46;
<P>

The <B>patternspairs</B> element is very similar to the <B>patterns</B> element except that the list of patterns is described by a cartesian product of two sets of patterns, <B>prepatterns</B> and <B>postpatterns</B>&#46; Both <B>prepatterns</B> and <B>postpatterns</B> must contain a non-empty list of <B>data</B> elements and nothing more&#46; The resulting patterns are made by concatenating every prepattern with every postpattern and leaving only those combinations that have the total number of non-masked bits equal to <B>totalbits</B> and the total number of non-masked bits in the postpattern part equal to <B>postbits</B>&#46; When the resulting pattern matches with a sequence of bytes, the address of a byte that matches with the start of the postpattern is passed to the <B>bap:patterns-action</B> method&#46;
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PATTERNCONSTRAINTS SCHEME</H2>

<P>

The <B>patternconstraints&#46;xml</B> file is used as the table of contents and contain a mapping between targets (languages in Ghidra parlance) and paths to corresponding files, relative to the location of the <B>patternconstraints&#46;xml</B> file&#46;
<P>

The file must have a single <B>patternconstraints</B> element that contains a list of <B>language</B> elements&#46; The language element is required to have the <B>id</B> attribute which must be either the name of a BAP target (see <B>bap list targets</B>) or a Ghidra language specification, which is four-tuple of elements, separated with <B>:</B>&#46; The first element is the architecture name, the second is the endiannes, the third is the bitness, and the last is the variant&#46; Any field except the architecture, could use <B>default</B> or just <B>*</B> as the wildcard character that matches with anything&#46; The endianness is specified as either <B>LE</B> for little or <B>BE</B> for big endianness&#46; For instructions in little endian and data in big endian, use <B>LEBE</B>&#46;
<P>

The <B>language</B> element contains a list of <B>patternfile</B> or <B>compiler</B> elements&#46; The <B>patternfile</B> element contains the path to the patterns file, and the <B>compiler</B> element contains the <B>patternfile</B> element with patterns specific to a compiler, which is specified in the required <B>id</B> attribute of the <B>compiler</B> element&#46;
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DITTED PATTERNS</H2>

<P>

Each pattern is described as a ditted sequence of bits or nibbles&#46; Each bit is represented with <B>0</B>, <B>1</B>, and <B>&#46;</B> that match, correspondigly with, zero, one, and any bit&#46; And a nibble is a a hexadecimal digit, matching with their corresponding four-bit representation, or <B>&#46;</B>, which matches with any four bits (i&#46;e&#46;, with any binary number in the range from <B>0</B> to <B>0xF</B>)&#46; The nibble sequence must start with <B>0x</B> and continues until the next whitespace character&#46; If the sequence doesn&#39;t start with <B>0x</B> then it is assumed to be a sequence of bits&#46; Sequences could be separated by the arbitrary number of whitespace characters&#46;
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUILTIN ACTIONS</H2>

<P>

All actions in the <B>bap</B> namespace, which is set as the default namespace when parsing the patterns file, are reserved to BAP&#46; It is possible to add arbitrary actions, provided that they are not using the <B>bap</B> namespace&#46; The following set of actions have predefined meaning&#46;
<P>

<B>functionstart</B> and <B>possiblefuncstart</B> mark the matching sequence as the function start&#46; The attributes could be used to impose an extra constraint&#46; The current implementation ignore them, but they will be implemented later&#46;
<P>

<B>setcontext</B> is used to control the disassembler context and currently the following two attributes are recongized, <B>name</B> and <B>value</B>&#46; When the name is set to <B>TMode</B> then the matching sequence has the encoding T32 if the value is <B>1</B> and A32 otherwise&#46;
